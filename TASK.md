Our users sometimes need to contact our customer care team. Add a customer care user that can chat with our users and the doctor about a given order. The customer care user should be able to see all messages in the system, but doctors can't see messages between the user and the customer care user and users can't see messages between the doctor and the customer care user.

If you find security issues, please fix them as a priority.

Write tests for the code you write.

Also write a test plan for our QA tester to be put in the PR.
