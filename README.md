## The Application

The application is a small extract of our main application. It's a part of the messaging system between users and doctors.
Users with active orders leverage the chat system to ask their doctor questions, ask for changes, and to perform refills.

Whilst this application is not representative of our main application, performing the requested task will expose you to the
same kinds of challenges you'll face in the real application.

## Tips

Treat this task as if you were working a real ticket on our team. Think about how the code currently works and how you
would feel maintaining it and what you add to it 6 months from now.

We want to see how you think about code and how you write it. If you see opportunities to improve the code, please feel free to change it.

We're also looking for you to write tests, but not for the entire application. We're looking for you to write tests for the
code you write.
